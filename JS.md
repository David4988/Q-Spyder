### * Dynamically Typed Language -> no need to specify the data type of the variable

### * Weakly Typed Language -> can change the type of the variable

### * Interpreted Language -> no need to compile the code

### * Synchronous in Nature(Single-threaded) -> step by step execution

    2. Node.js -> doesn'
